# Riskognize
A Game to show you know Risks and how to avoid them

# Idea
Step 1: Awareness for Risks as simple as a game

	Like the Game "Where is Walter (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wo_ist_Walter%3F)" you have 	to find riski situations within a (animated) picture. If click on a "riski Situation" you 	have to answer a question what you can do to minimize/prevent the risk.
	For every wright answer and foundet risk you get points.
	For finding and answering fast you get more points.
	
Step 2: Because you can't avoid every Risks know what insurance you need in case they happen
	
	Add Information about insurances to the Game....
